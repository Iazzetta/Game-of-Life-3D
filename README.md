## Running the Code
A running version of the code can be found at http://185.82.21.82/gameoflife. But you can also run it on your device. Simply fire up the index.html file in any browser that supports webGL. 

## The Game & Controlls
The Camera will always look at the center of the grid. To move the angles you have to move around your mouse while keeping left or right mouse key pressed any where on the screen.
To zoom in use the mouse wheel.   
At the start screen, first chose a grid size and what kind of shape you would like the cells to be represented. Note that when going for more than 
about 150 x 150 cubes (and about 100 x 100 for spheres) your device will probably have a hard time rendering and fps will be quite low.
Other than that you can just let the game randomly chose the inital state of the cells or you can pick them by hand. Then press "Enter".    
Chose some cells to be alive simply by clicking on it. Than start the game and see what you have created!   
The menu button is in the upper left corner. It contains a count of how many rounds the current game has been running. a Pause/Resume button and a Restart Button. 
The buttons do exactly what they say. The restart button will bring you back to the start screen and you can chose a new setup.    
In the upper right corner is a mute button, in case you get annoyed by the great sounds the game is creating for you. 

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
"r" = Restart
"p" = Pause
"q" = open Menu
"m" = Sound on / off
"Enter" = start game when on start screen
